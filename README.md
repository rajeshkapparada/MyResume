# Input
The application takes information from users in the form of a resume, which includes personal information, educational background, projects, and programming skills. This data is given as JSX components, and each segment in the React component gets data through props or straight from within the component.

# Process
The React component handles the data by rendering it in a structured way on the fly. The `Resume` part separates the data into different sections, such as personal information, schooling, projects, and programming skills. Each part is made with CSS, and the layout uses flexboxes to make sure it looks responsive and professional. The program reads each section and turns the data it is given into HTML elements like headers, paragraphs, and lists.

# Output
The final product is a well-organized resume that is shown on the website. The information is shown in clear parts, and there are interactive links, like an email address and phone number, that let people get in touch with the person directly.
